#Summernote Plugins
A few plugins I have developed for the [Summernote](https://github.com/summernote/summernote/) WYSIWYG editor

##summernote-emoji
A plugin to add a dropdown menu for adding emoji images with just a few clicks.  All images are embedded in the JS file as base64 strings, so output is entirely portable.  The CSS file is only for adding a few nice tweaks, not absolutely necessary.

I have only added my favorite emojis, though using my conversion tool at http://justineldracher.github.io/image-converter.html you can easily add your own.

##summernote-ext-specialchars
Just a few tweaks I made to the official SpecialChars plugin to suit my own taste and make it more mobile-friendly.  Navigate around the characters with the arrow keys and press enter to insert.  The arrow keys start at the character you last hovered over with you mouse.

I have demos of both plugins on my website: http://blindwarrior.16mb.com/writemsg.php

##summernote-fontawesome
Basically my special characters plugin, just with Font Awesome icons instead of special characters.
Features a search field to easily find icons, so it's a good reference tool if nothing else. ;)
